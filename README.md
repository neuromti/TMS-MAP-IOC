# TMS-MAP-IOC

Purpose: Exploration of influence of TMS-parameters on MEP Topography and Input-Output Curve
Includes:  MatLab Scripts and Functions used to analyze a TMS-Study

# Code Organization

Main/config_study.m (where i configure filestructure and global settings)

Main/mapping_study_processing.m (where i analyze the topography of the influence of TMS-parameters on MEP amplitude, latency and probabilty)

Main/ioc_study_processing.m (where i analyze the  the influence of TMS-parameters on the Input-Outpur-Curve of MEP amplitude, latency and probabilty)

Main/utils/ C(ontains several utility functions are organized as MatLab package in the +utils folder)
