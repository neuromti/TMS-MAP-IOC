# TMS-MAP-IOC
Exploration of Map Topography and Input-Output Curves for different TMS-parameters
These are the MatLab Scripts and Functions used to analyze a TMS-Study

Core Scripts are
config_study (where i configure filestructure and global settings)
mapping_study_processing (where i analyze the topography of the influence of TMS-parameters on MEP amplitude, latency and probabilty)
ioc_study_processing (where i analyze the  the influence of TMS-parameters on the Input-Outpur-Curve of MEP amplitude, latency and probabilty)

Utility functions are organized as MatLab package in the +utils folder
