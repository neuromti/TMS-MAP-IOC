# TMS-MAP-IOC

## Purpose

- Exploration of influence of TMS-parameters on MEP Topography and Input-Output Curve
- Includes: MatLab Scripts and Functions used to analyze a TMS-Study

## Code Organization

- code/config_study.m (Script to configure filestructure and global settings)

- code/mapping_study_processing.m (Script to analyze the topography of the influence of TMS-parameters on MEP amplitude, latency and probabilty)

- code/ioc_study_processing.m (Script to analyze the the influence of TMS-parameters on the Input-Outpur-Curve of MEP amplitude, latency and probabilty)

- code/+utils/ (Contains several utility functions are organized as MatLab package in the +utils folder)

- drafts/ (Contains drafts of the <manuscript>))
